# Weather bot

It's a chatbot for asking questions related primarily to the weather. You can also ask questions about historical data for the Boulder region in Colorado.

## Instructions

    1 - Use the "docker compose up" command to start the application.

    2 - To obtain the public URL generated by ngrok you can search in the ngrok logs or by accessing http://localhost:4040.

    3 - Then with the public URL it is possible to access the application.

This application was developed using Python version 3.9. The Streamlit framework was used to develop a user-friendly web interface. Additionally, the application consumes information from a service on HuggingFace that runs a Flowise AI, which can be viewed at https://huggingface.co/spaces/BryanMachin/WeatherBot.

To interact with the App you must define a session, with a username and a password. Then you can write questions that will be answered by our bot. If you want to delete all the messages from your session then you must use the "Clear Chat" button.

In the application folder there is a test environment that you can modify to use another version in Hugging Face. It contains: "API_URL", "CHATFLOW_ID" and "AUTHORIZATION".

You can test the app using the pytest framework by running the "pytest" command in a cmd console.
